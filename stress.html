            <p>Make no mistake about it, we all get stressed out from time to time. Some people just handle it better than others.

If you’re constantly looking for tips on how to feel less stressed, the answer could be in studying people who are simply better at managing stress than the average person.

Think of it this way. If you wanted to become a better cook, you’d study people that know how to cook. If you wanted to become a better writer, you’d study great writers. So if you want to know how to feel less stressed, why wouldn’t you follow that same concept and study people who handle incredible amounts of stress every day?

We’ve compiled a list of tips for feeling less stressed from some of the most successful people in the world. These are people who have accomplished a great deal in their life and deal with stress nearly every moment of their life. Yet they’re still able to find that balance and not let stress completely overwhelm them.</p>

            <p> Learn To Keep It Simple:
When it comes to feeling less stressed, mastering the art of simplicity is extremely helpful.

Stress is usually at its worst when one thing hits and another issue pops up right after.

Maybe you just found out that your hours are getting reduced at work. And, then when you get home you find out that your savings are going to be depleted because you have to install a new heating and air unit.

It’s easy to understand why anyone would become extremely stressed out in this type of scenario.</p>


            <p>Partake In A Favorite Hobby:
It is hard to deny that Meg Whitman has had a remarkable career. She has been involved with some of the most innovative and prolific companies of the modern times. Amongst these companies are P&G, eBay, and she has now taken on Hewlett-Packard.

You can just imagine how stressful it would be to try and compete in such grueling industries. You have to always worry about someone undercutting you and taking your job, pleasing the masses and coming up with innovative ideas that will awe the boardrooms.

Well, Whitman combats all of this by going fly-fishing with her six-year-old son. They go about six times a year and just let the steam out.

Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to take up fly-fishing. In fact, you can partake in any activity or hobby that you love.

If you don’t have something that you love to do, don’t be afraid to experiment around until you find something that soothes you. Maybe it is running, reading, gardening, camping or writing.

            <p>As you can see, stress is something we all face. By taking notes from some of the best in the business, we hope you have a better understanding of how to feel less stressed and have actionable takeaways you can use in your everyday life.

If these stress management tactics work for people who have built billion dollar companies and thrive on a daily basis, there’s no doubt they can help you achieve your goals and live a better life as well.</p>
